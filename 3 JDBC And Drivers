What is JDBC ???

JDBC(Java DataBase Connectivity):
-->The process of interacting with the database from Java Applications is called as JDBC.

-->JDBC is an API,which will provide very good predefined library to connect with database from JAVA Applications in order to perform the basic database operations.

-->In case of JDBC Applications we will define the database logic in Java application and we will send a Java represented database logic to Database Engine.But database engine is unable to execute the Java represented database logic,it should required the database logic in Query Language Representations.

-->In the above context, to execute JDBC applications we should require a conversion
mechanism to convert the database logic from Java representations to Query language representations and from Query language representations to Java representations.

-->In the above situation the required conversion mechanisms are available in the form
of a software called as "Driver".


Driver:
-->Driver is an interface existed between Java application and database to map Java API calls to Query language API calls and Query language API calls to Java API calls.

-->To provide driver as a product Sun MicroSystems has provided Driver as an interface.
And Sun MicroSystems lets the database vendors to provide implementation classes to the driver interface as part of their database software's.

-->If we want to use Drivers in JDBC applications then we have to get Driver implementation 
from the respective database software's.
