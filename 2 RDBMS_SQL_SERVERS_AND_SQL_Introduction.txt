What is RDBMS?
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.

RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.

A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system
(DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd.

What is a table?
The data in an RDBMS is stored in database objects which are called as tables. This table
is basically a collection of related data entries and it consists of numerous columns and
rows.

Remember, a table is the most common and simplest form of data storage in a relational
database. The following program is an example of a 
EMPLOYEE table:


+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
| ID | NAME | AGE | ADDRESS | SALARY |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
| 1 | Ramesh | 32 | Ahmedabad | 2000.00 |
| 2 | Khilan | 25 | Delhi | 1500.00 |
| 3 | kaushik | 23 | Kota | 2000.00 |
| 4 | Chaitali | 25 | Mumbai | 6500.00 |
| 5 | Hardik | 27 | Bhopal | 8500.00 |
| 6 | Komal | 22 | MP | 4500.00 |
| 7 | Muffy | 24 | Indore | 10000.00 |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+


What is a field?
Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. The fields in the CUSTOMERS
table consist of ID, NAME, AGE, ADDRESS and SALARY.
A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every
record in the table.

What is a Record or a Row?
A record is also called as a row of data or each individual entry that exists in a table. For example, there are 7 records in the above CUSTOMERS table. Following is a single row of
data or record in the CUSTOMERS table:
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
| 1 | Ramesh | 32 | Ahmedabad | 2000.00 |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
A record is a horizontal entity in a table.




What is a column?
A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a
specific field in a table.
For example, a column in the CUSTOMERS table is ADDRESS, which represents location
description and would be as shown below:
+-----------+
| ADDRESS |
+-----------+
| Ahmedabad |
| Delhi |
| Kota |
| Mumbai |
| Bhopal |
| MP |
| Indore |
+----+------+




There are many popular RDBMS available to work with. This tutorial gives a brief overview
of some of the most popular RDBMS’s. This would help you to compare their basic features.


MySQL
MySQL is an open source SQL database, which is developed by a Swedish company –
MySQL AB. MySQL is pronounced as "my ess-que-ell," in contrast with SQL, pronounced
"sequel."
MySQL is supporting many different platforms including Microsoft Windows, the major
Linux distributions, UNIX, and Mac OS X.
MySQL has free and paid versions, depending on its usage (non-commercial/commercial)
and features. MySQL comes with a very fast, multi-threaded, multi-user and robust SQL
database server.

MS SQL Server
MS SQL Server is a Relational Database Management System developed by Microsoft Inc.
Its primary query languages are:
 T-SQL
 ANSI SQL


ORACLE
It is a very large multi-user based database management system. Oracle is a relational
database management system developed by 'Oracle Corporation'.
Oracle works to efficiently manage its resources, a database of information among the
multiple clients requesting and sending data in the network.
It is an excellent database server choice for client/server computing. Oracle supports all
major operating systems for both clients and servers, including MSDOS, NetWare,
UnixWare, OS/2 and most UNIX flavors.


MS ACCESS
This is one of the most popular Microsoft products. Microsoft Access is an entry-level
database management software. MS Access database is not only inexpensive but also a
powerful database for small-scale projects.
MS Access uses the Jet database engine, which utilizes a specific SQL language dialect
(sometimes referred to as Jet SQL).
MS Access comes with the professional edition of MS Office package. MS Access has easyto-use intuitive graphical interface.
 1992 - Access version 1.0 was released.
 1993 - Access 1.1 released to improve compatibility with inclusion the Access Basic
programming language.
 The most significant transition was from Access 97 to Access 2000
 2007 - Access 2007, a new database format was introduced ACCDB which supports
complex data types such as multi valued and attachment fields.






SQL :- 
SQL is a language to operate databases; it includes database creation, deletion, fetching
rows, modifying rows, etc. SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute)
standard language, but there are many different versions of the SQL language.


What is SQL?
SQL is Structured Query Language, which is a computer language for storing, manipulating
and retrieving data stored in a relational database.

SQL is the standard language for Relational Database System. All the Relational Database
Management Systems (RDMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres
and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.

Also, they are using different dialects, such as:
 MS SQL Server using T-SQL,
 Oracle using PL/SQL,
 MS Access version of SQL is called JET SQL (native format) etc



Why SQL?
SQL is widely popular because it offers the following advantages:
 Allows users to access data in the relational database management systems.
 Allows users to describe the data.
 Allows users to define the data in a database and manipulate that data.
 Allows to embed within other languages using SQL modules, libraries &
pre-compilers.
 Allows users to create and drop databases and tables.
 Allows users to create view, stored procedure, functions in a database.
 Allows users to set permissions on tables, procedures and views.



SQL Commands

The standard SQL commands to interact with relational databases are CREATE, SELECT,
INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and DROP. These commands can be classified into the following
groups based on their nature:

DDL - Data Definition Language
--CREATE Creates a new table, a view of a table, or other object in the database.
--ALTER Modifies an existing database object, such as a table.
--DROP Deletes an entire table, a view of a table or other objects in the database.


DML - Data Manipulation Language
--SELECT Retrieves certain records from one or more tables.
--INSERT Creates a record.
--UPDATE Modifies records.
--DELETE Deletes records.


DCL - Data Control Language
--GRANT Gives a privilege to user.
--REVOKE Takes back privileges granted from user.
